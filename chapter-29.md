#### 29. Learn How To Fail



As programmers, we know that the sooner in the development process
that we can discover software failures, the more robust the software is
going to be. Unit testing helps us ferret out the strange bugs as early as
we can. If we discover bizarre errors in our own code, if they happen
early, we are happy. Though they signify a small failure on our part as
developers—we made a programming error—finding them early and
often is a good sign of what the health of the software will become.



We are taught to allow our programming errors to be loud and messy
early on. You want to know about them when they happen so you can
put the correct fixes or defensive measures in place. When you’re cod-
ing, you don’t go out of your way to silence the little software failures
that are destined to arise during development. That is the code’s way
of talking to you. Those little failures are part of the strengthening pro-
cess. So, we add assertions that crash our programs when something
goes wrong or unit tests that turn a bar red if we goof up.



The little failures we encounter also teach us what kind of failures to
expect. If you’ve never walked through a minefield before, you might
not know which lumps of dirt _not_ to step on. If your software hasn’t
been complaining to you regularly, you might not know where the dan-
gerous nooks and crannies are. You can program just so defensively
when you’re coding blind.



Furthermore, it’s important to program defensively. Software quality
is really put to the test when things go wrong. It’s inevitable that _something_ 
will happen for which you did not build a contingency case. Seg-
faults and blue screens in production code mean that the programmers
didn’t do a good job of dealing with the failures they couldn’t foresee.



> *Every wrong note is but one step away from a right one.*



The same principles apply on the job. A craftsperson is really put to the test 
when the errors arise. Learning to deal with mistakes is a skill that is both 
highly valuable and difficult to teach. As a jazz improviser, I learned that 
every wrong note is at most one step away from a right one. What makes 
improvisations bad is when the improviser doesn’t know what to do when the 
wrong note pops out. Standing in front of a band on one side and an audience 
on another, the sound of a real stinker of a note is enough to freeze an 
amateur to the bone. Even the masters play wrong notes. But they recover in 
such a way that the listener can’t tell that the whole thing wasn’t intentional.



We’re all going to make stupid mistakes on the job. It’s part of being
human. We make coding mistakes that lead to customers looking at
stack traces. We paint ourselves into corners with critical design mis-
takes. Or, worse, we say the wrong things to our team members, man-
agers, and customers. We make bad commitments or false claims about
what we’re capable of doing. Or we accidentally give our team mem-
bers bad advice on how to solve a technical problem, wasting hours of
their time.



Because we all make mistakes, we also know that everyone else makes
mistakes. So, within reason, we don’t judge each other on the mistakes
we make. We judge each other on how we deal with those inevitable
mistakes.



Whether it is a technical, communication, or project management mis-
take, the following rules apply:



+ Raise the issue as early as you know about it. Don’t try to hide it
  for any length of time. As in software development and testing,
  mistakes caught early are less of a problem than mistakes caught
  late. The earlier you suck it up and expose what you’ve done, the
  less the negative impact is likely to have.



+ Take the blame. Don’t try to look for a scapegoat even if you
  can find a good one. Even if you’re not wholly to blame, take
  responsibility and move on. The goal is to move past this point
  as quickly as possible. A problem needs a resolution. Lingering
  on whose fault it is only prolongs the issue.


+ Offer a solution. If you don’t have one, offer a plan of attack for
  finding a solution. Speak in terms of concrete, predictable time
  frames. If you’ve designed your team into a corner, give time
  frames on when you will get back with an assessment of the
  effort required to reverse the issue. Concrete, attainable goals,
  even if small and immaterial, are important at this stage. Not only
  do they keep things moving from bad to good, but they help to
  rebuild credibility in the process.



+ Ask for help. Even if you are solely to blame for a problem, don’t
  let your pride make it worse by refusing help in a resolution. Your
  team members, management, and customers will look at you in
  a much more positive light if you can maintain a healthy attitude
  and set your ego aside while the team helps you dig your way
  out. Too often, we feel a sense of responsibility that drives us to
  proudly shoulder a burden too large, and we end up thrashing
  unproductively until someone forcibly intervenes.



Think about the last time you experienced a customer service issue
at a restaurant. Perhaps you waited way too long for the _wrong dish_
to ultimately reach your table. Think about how the waiter reacted to
your complaint.



> *The Stressful times offer the best opportunities to build loyalty.*



The wrong reaction is for the waiter to
make excuses or to blame the cooks. 
wrong reaction would be for the waiter to 
walk off to resubmit the order and stay out 
of sight while you sit there starving and
wondering when the hell your food is finally going to arrive. Of the
course, the _really_ wrong reaction would be for the waiter to arrive with
a dish that he already knows is wrong, hoping you would either not
notice or not complain.



The difference between how a company treats us when they make a
mistake can be the ultimate in loyalty building (or destroying). A mis-
take handled well might make us more loyal customers than we would
have been had we never experienced a service problem. Remember this
with _your_ customers when you make mistakes on the job.
