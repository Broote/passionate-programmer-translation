#### 16. The Way That You Do It

“Developing software” is not a thing, a noun. Instead, “developing
software” is a _verb phrase_; it’s the _process_ of creating a thing. When we’re
coding away, it’s as important to focus on the process we’re using as
it is to focus on the product being developed. Take your eye off the
process, and you risk delivering late, delivering the wrong product, or
not delivering at all. These outcomes tend to be frowned on by our
customers.

Fortunately, a lot of thought has been put into the process of making
good software (and products in general). Much of this prior art has
been codified into a group of _methodologies_. These methodologies are
the subject of numerous books that can be found online or in your local
bookstore.

Unfortunately, most developers don’t get to benefit from all this good
information. For the majority of teams, the process is an afterthought
or something imposed from above. The word _methodology_ has, in their
minds, become synonymous with paperwork and long, meaningless
meetings. All too often, a methodology is something that their managers impose.

Managers intuitively know that they need to follow _some kind_ of process,
but they often don’t know about the options that are now available.
As a result, they dust off the same processes that were imposed
on them in the 1980s, wrap them up in buzzword-compliant ribbons
(the pastel-colored Agile ribbon is a good choice at the moment), and
pass the practices on to their teams. And unless someone breaks the
cycle by actually doing research on what works and what doesn’t, the
same process will happen again as the developers on the team become
managers themselves.

You’d think that there must be a better way to develop software. And
for most teams there is.

If you’re a programmer, tester, or software designer, you may not think
the development process is your responsibility. As far as your company
is concerned, you’re probably right. Unfortunately, it’s usually _nobody’s_
responsibility. If it does get assigned to someone, it might fall into the
hole of a “process group” or some other similarly disconnected organization.
The truth is that for a software process to have any chance of
being implemented successfully, it has to be embraced by the people
who are using the process — people like you.

The best way to feel ownership of these processes is to help implement
them. If your organization has no process, research methodologies that
might work for you. Have brown-bag lunches with your team to discuss
current development problems and ways that adopting a standard
process might mitigate them. Put together a plan for rolling the chosen
process into your organization, and get everyone’s buy-in. Then start
to implement your plan.

> **If you want to feel you own a process, help implement it.**

Alternatively, you might work in an environment where a process is passed down
from on high. By the time the tablets arrive
at the development team, the practices
have often been watered down and reinterpreted to the point where they’re
unrecognizable from the originals.
The process has suffered the same fate as the secret phrase in a game of
[Chinese Whispers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers).
Again, this is an opportunity to take the initiative.
Research the methodology you’ve been given, and help interpret what
it really means, both to your team and to your management. You’re not
going to be able to fight that a process has been imposed, so you may
as well make it work by doing it right.

The methodology world can quickly begin to sound like a hollow shell
of buzzwords. But, as buzzword compliant as some may be, you can
always learn _something_ from the study of a software process — even if
that something is what not to do. If you’re well versed in the software
process landscape, you can make a more credible argument for how
your team should be working.

Even with the abundance of prescriptive methodologies to choose
from, it’s not likely you will ever work for a company that fully implements
any of them. That’s OK. The best process to follow is the one that
makes your team most productive and results in the best products.

##### Methodologies: Not Just for Geeks

Though project management is not necessarily bound
to software development methodology, you may find
yourself running face first into your company’s project
management techniques. Numerous project manage-
ment methodologies are in use throughout the industry.
Probably most notable is the Project Management Institute’s
[Project Management Book of Knowledge](http://www.pmi.org/),
(with its widely recognized certification program).
[Six Sigma](http://www.isixsigma.com/) is another non-software-specific quality
methodology. Driven by companies such as General
Electric and Motorola, the Six Sigma approach emphasizes
the measurement and analysis of processes and
products to drive customer satisfaction and efficiency.
Although not specific to software development, Six
Sigma’s rigorous and methodical approach offers many
lessons that are directly applicable to your job as a programmer.

The only way to find that hybrid (short of revelationary epiphany) is to
study the available options, pick out the pieces that make sense to you
and your team, and continuously refine them based on real experience.
Ultimately, if you can’t do the process, you can’t do the product. It’s
much easier to find someone who can make software work than it is to
find someone who can make the _making of_ software work. So, adding
knowledge of the software development process to your arsenal can
only help you.

##### Act on It!

1. Pick a software development methodology, and pick up a book,
start reading websites, and join a mailing list. Look at the methodology
with a critical eye. What do you think would be its strong and
weak points? What would be the barriers to implementing it where
you work? Next, do the same with another. Contrast their strengths
and weaknesses. How could you combine their approaches?
