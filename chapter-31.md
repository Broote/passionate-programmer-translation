#### 31. Don’t Panic



I started my career as a computer programmer because of video games.
Since the days of loading games from tape on my Commodore 64,
I’ve been hooked by their immersive, interactive experiences. I used
to be embarrassed to admit it, but I realize now that it’s nothing to be
ashamed of. For me, computer games turned the on-screen environ-
ment (the operating system, I guess) into an environment I was com-
fortable and excited about.


My favorite game ever was id Software’s Doom. I was specifically in
love with the one-on-one, player-vs.-player, death-match part of the
game. Players would connect via modem or serial connection and bat-
tle each other in small, fast-paced environments. I got really good at
the Doom death match. I often joke that it might be the thing in my life
so far that I’m best at. The game of death match is surprisingly com-
plex. It’s both technical and psychological—like a frenetic mix of chess
and fencing on fast-forward.



Like most skills, a great way to get good at it is to watch masters at
work. Back in my Doom days, there was one such master who went
by the ironic online handle “Noskill.” Noskill was the de facto reign-
ing Doom champion. People from around North America would pay
the long-distance telephone fees to try their luck against him. These
matches would all be recorded with Doom’s built-in game-recording
facility. I watched every one.



It didn’t take me long to learn his secret. Sure, he was generally good
at the game, but there was one obvious key to his success: he never
panicked. Doom was the kind of game in which a round could be over
literally seconds after it started. It was really fast. I remember my first
death-match game. Spawn, die, spawn, die, spawn, die. When I finally
managed to stay alive more than a couple of seconds I found myself
running around aimlessly, barely able to keep track of where I was.



But Noskill never acted that way. No matter how difficult the situation,
you could tell by watching the recordings that he was always relaxed
and always thinking about what to do next. He was always seemingly
aware of how his current context fit into the overall shape of the match.



> *Heroes never panic.*



Now if you think about other games, particularly sports, you’ll recognize that the
best players all share this quality. In fact, even the characters we admire in 
books, television, and movies share this quality. Heroes never panic. They’re 
always the people who can have a nuclear bomb dropped on their city or crash in 
an airplane and manage to organize a group, help the survivors, outsmart the enemy,
or at least just not break down in tears.



This extends to real life, too. Despite my best planning, my professional
life has been a string of emergencies and disasters. Projects run really
really late. Software applications crash, costing my employers money
and credibility. I say the wrong thing to the wrong vice president and
gain a political enemy. Most of the time, these things come in waves all
together, never one at a time.



In my worst moments, I panic. I lock up and can think tactically at
best. I react to each small input without the clarity to consider the big
picture.



But looking back on literally _every_ such disaster, not a single one has
made a lasting, noticeable impact on me or my career. So, as panicked
or depressed or upset as I’ve gotten over these seemingly disastrous
situations, not one has been a _true_ disaster.



What did the panicking give me? What was the advantage of reacting
negatively to each of these situations? Nothing. What panicking really
gave me was an inability to perform at my best at the times I really
needed to be performing at my best.



Now I have to admit that not panicking in stressful situations is easier
said than done. It’s kind of like telling someone “just be happy.” Sure,
it’s good advice, but how do you do it? How do you avoid panicking
when things seem to be falling apart? To answer this question, it helps
to think a little about why we _do_ panic.



We panic because we lose perspective. When something has going
wrong, it’s hard not to focus all attention on the problem. To some
extent, that’s a good way to solve problems. Unfortunately, it also
makes the problem, no matter how small, seem more important than
it is. And with the problem inflated and stress levels running high, our
brains turn themselves off.



Who is the worst computer user you know? For me, it’s probably one
of my parents or in-laws (I know who, but I’m smart enough not to
name any names here). Imagine that person sitting at their computer
trying to finish a project when an error message start popping up with
everything they try to do. We’ve all seen this happen. Inexperienced
computer users get quickly frustrated and freaked out. They start hec-
tically clicking and dragging things around on the screen, ignoring
the potentially helpful error message text as it pops up over and over
again. They eventually get so flustered that they have to call for help,
but usually not before messing up one or two additional things on the
computer before doing so.



Don’t think I’m mean, but I want you to picture this situation with
someone appropriate you know as the main character, and I want you
to laugh to yourself about it. This kind of behavior really is ridiculous,
isn’t it? It’s laughable.



But, as genuinely funny as this is, what we just imagined was a real-
life scenario in which a person working outside their comfort zone
encountered a problem and panicked. It’s no different from the way
I’ve reacted when projects have run late or I’ve accidentally crashed
a system or I’ve dissatisfied a customer on the job. It’s just a different
context.



So, here’s how I’m learning to not panic. When something bad happens
and I start to feel that sinking, stressed-out feeling that leads to panic,
I compare myself to the frustrated computer-illiterate, and I laugh at
myself. I analyze the situation from the third-person perspective, as if
I’m helping that frustrated family member with their word processing
disaster. Seemingly hard problems are suddenly easier. Seemingly bad
situations are suddenly not so bad. And, I often find that the solution
simple and staring me in the face in the same way that an error dialog
often tells you exactly what to do next. If you’d just have the presence
of mind to read the error message, the problem might be solved.



Act on It!
1. Keep a panic journal. The key to catching panic before it happens
   is to develop a heightened real-time awareness of your percep-
   tion and emotions as they happen. I’ve had my best luck learning
   to do this by analyzing my reactions to situations after the fact. I’m
   not smart enough to naturally keep a background thread running
   and analyzing my thoughts as they happen, but I’ve discovered
   that if I practice the analysis “offline,” I get better and better at
   doing the analysis in real time.
   
   
   
   Saying you’re going to do a better job of analyzing your reactions
   and actually doing it are two different things. Keeping a journal will
   help add structure to the process. Each day at a specific time (use
   a calendar with a reminder!), open up a text file and record any
   situation that caused you to panic, even if only a little bit. Once
   a week, look back on the past week’s list and take stock of the
   lasting impact of each panic-inducing situation. Was the situation
   panic-worthy? What would have been the most productive reac-
   tion to the situation? What would the hero in a dramatized movie
   about your life have done instead of panicking?
   
   
   
   After some practice, you’ll find the analysis to start happening
   _while_ the panic sets in. As you rationally explore the reasons for
   your panic in real time, you’ll find that the panic itself takes a back-
   seat and eventually dissipates.
