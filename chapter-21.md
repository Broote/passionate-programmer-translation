#### 21. Daily Hit



We all like to believe, by virtue of our knowledge and that we’re good software 
people, that we are going to naturally nail execution and be top performers. 
For a lucky few (and I _do_ mean to use the word _luck_ here), a strategy like 
this will work.



But, all of us can benefit from scheduling and tracking our accomplishments. 
Common sense tells us that if we exceed our managers’ expectations, we’ll be on 
the A list. Given that exceeding expectations is a worthy goal, surprisingly 
few of us have mechanisms of tracking how and when we exceed the expectations 
of our employers.



As with most tasks that are worth doing, becoming a standout performer is more 
likely with some specific and intentional work. When was the last time you went 
above and beyond the call of duty? Did your manager know about it? How can you 
increase the _visible_ instances of this behavior?



*Have an accomplishment to report every day.*



James McMurry, a co-worker who’s also a good friend, told me very early in 
both of our careers about a system he had worked up to make sure he was doing a 
good job. It struck me as being remarkably insightful given his level of 
experience (maybe it’s a hint he got from his parents), and I use it to this 
day. Without warning his manager, he started tracking _daily hits_. His goal was 
to, each day, have some kind of outstanding accomplishment to report to his 
manager—some idea he had thought of or implemented that would make his 
department better.



Simply setting a goal (daily, weekly, or whatever you’re capable of) and 
tracking this type of accomplishment can radically change your behavior. When 
you start to search for outstanding accomplishments, you naturally go through 
the process of evaluating and prioritizing your activities based on the 
business value of what you might work on.



Tracking hits at a reasonably high frequency will ensure that you don’t get 
stuck: if you’re supposed to produce a hit per day, you can’t spend

Figure 2: One week of hits
Monday - Automate the Build!
Tuesday - Write tests for feed parsing code
Wednesday - Look into Object/Releatioal Mapping tools so we can stop writing 
all that SQL!
Thursday - Script the web app deployment process
Friday - Clean up the project`s compilation warnings

two weeks crafting the _perfect_ task. This type of thinking and work becomes 
a habit rather than a major production. And, like a developer addicted to the 
green bar of a unit test suite, you start to get itchy if you haven’t knocked 
out today’s hit. You don’t have to worry so much about tracking your progress, 
because performing at this level becomes more akin to a nervous tic than a set 
of tasks that need to be planned out in Microsoft Project.



Act on It!
##### Действуйте!



Block off half an hour on your calendar, and sit down with a pencil and paper 
in a quiet place where you won’t be interrupted. Think about the little 
nitpicky problems your team puts up with on a daily basis. Write them down. 
What are the annoying tasks that waste a few minutes of the team’s time each 
day but nobody has had the time or energy to do anything about?  Where in your 
current project are you doing something manually that could be automated? Write 
it down. How about your build or deployment process? Anything you could clean 
up? How might you reduce failures in your build? Write all of these ideas 
down. Give yourself a solid twenty minutes of this. Write down all of your 
ideas—good or bad. Don’t allow yourself to quit until the twenty minutes are 
up. After you’ve made your list, on a new sheet of paper write out your five 
favorite (most annoying) items. Next week, on Monday, take the first item from 
the list, and do something about it. On Tuesday, take the second item, 
Wednesday the third, and so on.
